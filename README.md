# Eric Gregory

Hello, I'm a software engineer based in beautiful, foggy San Francisco.

Over the past ~16 years of my career, I have: 
* Built and maintained products from desktops software to embedded systems
* Worked on fullstack systems with a backend focus (Django/Postgres/AWS)
* Developed in Python, C++, JavaScript... and a few languages you've never heard of
* Written countless unit tests and automated QA tests
* Mentored junior engineers
